# Digital-challenege
# Introduction
Welcome to the Module 2 project! This project is an opportunity for you to apply all the skills and knowledge you have accumulated throughout the module, as well as new concepts you will learn over the next two weeks. You are not expected to know everything from the start; you will learn and apply the following topics during this project:

EDA and Data Cleaning
Performance Metrics
Hypothesis Testing
Experiment Evaluation
Tableau

# Setup
You will work in pairs for this project. Create a Kanban board for project management to help divide the work efficiently between you and your partner.

# Typical Day
You will work on the project in the afternoons with your partner. The final two days of the project are reserved for dedicated project work, leading up to the presentation on the Friday of week 6.

# Project Brief

# Context
You are a newly employed data analyst in the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, a US-based investment management company. Your first task is to analyze the results of a recently launched digital experiment aimed at improving the user interface and increasing process completion rates.

# The Digital Challenge
Vanguard has introduced a new, more intuitive UI with in-context prompts to see if these changes will encourage more clients to complete their online processes.

# The Experiment Conducted
An A/B test was conducted from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017:

- Control Group: Clients used the traditional online process.

- Test Group: Clients experienced the new digital interface.

Both groups followed the same process sequence: an initial page, three subsequent steps, and a confirmation page signaling process completion. The goal is to determine if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates.

# Your Data Tools
You will work with three datasets:

- Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Contains demographics like age, gender, and account details.

- Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data): Detailed client interactions online, divided into two parts (pt_1 and pt_2). Merge these files before analysis.

- Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): Lists clients involved in the experiment.

# Topics & Tasks by Day

Your main objective is to analyze the experiment’s performance. Below is a suggested division of tasks by day:

# Day 1 & 2 (Week 5)
EDA & Data Cleaning
- Dataset Exploration
- Client behavior analysis

# Day 3 (Week 5)
Performance Metrics
- Review KPIs & Metrics
- Identify Success Indicators
Completion Rate: Proportion of users who reach the final ‘confirm’ step.
Time Spent on Each Step: Average duration users spend on each step.
Error Rates: Steps where users go back to a previous step indicating confusion or error.
Compare new design performance to the old one using chosen KPIs.

# Day 4 & 5 (Week 5)
Hypothesis Testing

- Test hypothesis related to completion rates between Test and Control groups.
- Ensure the observed increase in completion rate meets or exceeds a 5% threshold to justify the costs of the new design.
- Conduct other relevant hypothesis tests (e.g., age, client tenure, gender differences).

# Experiment Evaluation

Evaluate the design effectiveness, experiment duration, and additional data needs.

# Day 1 & 2 (Week 6)
Tableau
- Create insightful and interactive visualizations using Tableau.

# Day 3 & 4 (Week 6)
- Finalize and enhance all tasks from previous days.
- Create a comprehensive project presentation due on Friday.
- Ensure the project offers clear insights, well-defined deliverables, and organized code.
-Address any optional bonus tasks if applicable.
-Review self-guided lessons on the relevant topics.

# Conclusion
By following the outlined tasks and leveraging the provided datasets, you will be able to assess the effectiveness of Vanguard’s new digital interface and provide data-driven recommendations to the CX team. Good luck, and enjoy the learning experience!
